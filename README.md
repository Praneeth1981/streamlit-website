# streamlit-website
I have created a small and polished website leveraging Python and the Streamlit framework.

## Requirements
To run this code you must intall streamlit in the terminal
- 'pip install streamlit'
- 'pip install --upgrade streamlit' (if not updated)

## Run the file
Run app.py file using command:
- 'streamlit run app.py'
A web interface appears displaying the contents of the websites.
